# FizzBuzz in C Language

A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. Multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number, and multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Through the FizzBuzz exercise, I have learned the following key programming concepts:

1. Conditional Statements: I practiced using if, else if, and else statements to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.

2. Loops: I learned how to use a while loop to iterate over a range of numbers, processing each number in sequence.

3. Modulo Operator: I understood the use of the modulo operator (%) to determine divisibility, which is key to the logic of the FizzBuzz problem.

4. Output Formatting: I utilized the printf function in C to format and print strings and integers to the console.

5. Incrementing Values: I practiced incrementing a variable within a loop to move through a series of values.

6. Basic Program Structure: I reinforced my understanding of the basic structure of a C program, including including necessary headers, defining the main function, and managing program flow.

These concepts are fundamental in many programming tasks and will serve as a solid foundation for more complex coding challenges in the future. Great job on tackling FizzBuzz! 🚀😊
